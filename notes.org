*** how to to

The content at the very begginign is quite simple.  At least for me.
The idea than would be to read some part of the book, and only if
needed try to implement it to play around with stuff.  I've started
that way at the very beginning - read some, and than decided that code
base could be beneficial.

What I liked in particular was this process of catching up.  You code,
you know where are you trying to get to, and while trying to this on
your own you see which gaps still do require filling up.
